## Force Rules

<span class="bold">And They Shall Know No Fear:</span> Each time a Combat Attrition test is taken for this unit, ignore any or all modifiers ()

<span class="bold">Angels of Death:</span> This unit has the following abilities: And They Shall Know No Fear, Bolter Discipline, Shock Assault and Combat Doctrines. ()

<span class="bold">Bolter Discipline:</span> Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, models in this unit shooting Rapid Fire bolt weapons make double the number of attacks if any of the following apply  

- The shooting model's target is within half the weapon's range  
- The shooting model is Infantry (excluding Centurion models) and it's unit Remained Stationary in your previous Movement Phase.  
- The shooting model is a Terminator or Biker  

For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any bolt weapon (see page 195) with the Rapid Fire type. ()

<span class="bold">Combat Doctrines:</span> (See page 125 of Codex Space Marines) ()

<span class="bold">Righteous Zeal:</span> - You can re-roll Advance rolls and charge rolls made for units with this tactic.  
- Each time a model with this tactic would lose a wound as a result of a mortal wound, roll one D6; on a 5+, that wound is not lost ()

<span class="bold">Shock Assault:</span> Each time this unit fights if it made a charge move, was charged or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, then until that fight is resolved, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in this unit. ()

<span class="bold">Vows:</span> If every unit in your army (excluding UNALIGNED units) has the BLACK TEMPLARS keyword, then every unit that has the Combat Doctrines ability (see Codex: Space Marines) and is in a BLACK TEMPLARS Detachment gains the Templar Vows ability, below:  

TEMPLAR VOWS  
At the end of the Read Mission Briefing step, you can select one of the following Templar Vows  

• Suffer Not the Unclean to Live  
• Uphold the Honour of the Emperor  
• Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch  
• Accept any Challenge, No Matter the Odds  

Until the end of the battle, all units from your army with the Templar Vows ability gain the effects of the selected vow. The effects of each vow can be found on pages 44-45\. Each vow provides a series of abilities as well as a passion. Each passion is a drawback that affects Black Templars units while they are under the effects of that vow. ()

## Selection Rules

<span class="bold">Angels of Death:</span> This unit has the following abilities: And They Shall Know No Fear, Bolter Discipline, Shock Assault and Combat Doctrines. ()

<span class="bold">Combat Squads:</span> Before any models are deployed at the start of the game, this unit when containing its maximum number of models, may be split into two units each containing an equal number of models. ()

<span class="bold">Combi Weapon:</span> When attacking with this weapon, choose one or both of the profiles. If you choose both, subtract 1 from all hit rolls for this weapon. ()

<span class="bold">Concealed Positions:</span> During Deployment when you set up this unit, if every model in this unit has this ability then it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from the enemy deployment zone and any enemy models ()

<span class="bold">Teleport Strike:</span> During deployment, you can set up this model in a teleportarium chamber instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement phases this model can teleport into battle - set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models. ()
